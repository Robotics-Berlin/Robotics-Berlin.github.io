I’m happy to announce the second robotics Berlin meetup is going to be hold at the **25th of March, 7 p.m.** at the **PTScientists office in Märkische Allee 82A, 12681 Berlin**. PTScientists will provide drinks and light snacks. Please register via email to me by the 24th March, if you want to come. Again this will be very informal as our first meetup, so don’t expect any formal talks, but rather chats between equals. However, feel free to bring a robot (if it fits a normal meeting room).
