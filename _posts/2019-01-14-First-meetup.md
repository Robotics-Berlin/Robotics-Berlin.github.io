title: The first Berlin robotics meetup hosted at Amazon
user: Johannes
---

The first meetup will take place at the 29th January 2019, 7 pm . Since
everybody will be new please prepare a (max!) 5 min introduction of yourself (or
your group).  We encourage everybody to bring robots (as long as they fit in a
normal meeting room).

The meetup will be hosted by Johannes and Sebastian from Amazon Robotics AI in
Krausenstr. 38, 10117 Berlin. Amazon will sponsor drinks and food this time. You
will need to provide your name to the Amazon reception upon entering the
building (but no need for an NDA, since it is a semi-public space). Please
register with jkkulick -at- amazon.com at least one day prior to the meetup if
you want to come.
